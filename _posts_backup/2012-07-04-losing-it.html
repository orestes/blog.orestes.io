Today I almost lost it. It's amazing how stressful moving can be. In the proccess of moviong offices, my chair, keyboard, and my best monitor were all lost. Actually, different people tryied to take them for themselves. I felt I was dealing with kids instead of grownups. Luckily I'd seen this coming and labeled my stuff at weird places so they couldn't say it was their stuff. My chair was nicely labeled. With the name of one of the tech support guys. It felt like teaching a lesson to a kid when I flipped the chair and showed him my name under the seat. I felt bad I had to get to that. A few hours later, the Director of Operations talks about respecting each other at the new office and whatnot. 

I was already angry because of how they were leaving me out of decisions about stuff like how to divide the space and set the isles in the new office, to the point I thoght I had lost the new team member position because he/she had no table assigned. Turns out he/she had, but in the creatives aisle. But nobody told me about it. Even better, the person in charge of the move told me he had no room for it, and that he didn't believe we needed a new team member to replace the lost one.Â
