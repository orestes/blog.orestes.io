<p>I passed the certification exam about a month ago. Today I got my certification :)</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages#show-ClientCandidateID=ZEND018312">my profile on Zend Yellow Pages</a></p>
<p>I've written about the study process and the motivation to get this certification on this blog. Now that I have it, I'll have to see if it helps me in the future. For starters, I now know the expertise level you need to pass this exam, and I can evaluate a little better candidates who have it too. When I met somebody with this certification, I can safely assume he/she knows his PHP stuff. Now I'm thinking about the future 5.4 certification given that the final 5.4 release is just around the corner. I'll try to keep up to date with the new 5.4 features and get the certification as soon as it becomes available.</p>
