<p><img src="/assets/zce.jpg" alt="PHP 5.3 Zend Certified Engineer"/>I passed the certification exam about a month ago. Today I got my certification :)</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages#show-ClientCandidateID=ZEND018312">my profile on Zend Yellow Pages</a></p>
<p>I've written about the study process and the motivation to get this certification on this blog. Now that I have it, I'll have to see if it helps me in the future. For starters, I now know the expertise level you need to pass this exam, and I can evaluate a little better candidates who have it too. When I met somebody with this certification, I can safely assume he/she knows his PHP stuff. Now I'm thinking about the future 5.4 certification given that the final 5.4 release is just around the corner. </p>
