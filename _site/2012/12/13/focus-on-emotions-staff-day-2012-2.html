<p>Today, my company (Focus On Emotions) is having the second Staff Day of 2012. We have one at the start of summer and another at the start of winter. On the Staff Day, we usually don't work, and we get together in meeting room to be updated on the company status and course.</p>

<p>This time I'm not at the company's headquarters in Barcelona but that's not a problem when you have a laptop and access to the Internet :)</p>
