<p>Ok, I have to tell you about this. I was looking for information about "Ingress" which is some kind of game a few people are playing but nobody seems to know how to get access to. I was browsing around and found out about something called "Niantic Project". Apparently there's something big going on and only a handful of people and aware of it, the ones playing Ingress. </p>

I found a few cool pictures while googling around, nothing too weird,. I wanted to save some for later, but I accidentally saved this one as a .html file and that's when things got weird.</p>

<p><strong>Try and do it yourself.</strong> Save this image to your local disk, and rename it to from <code>.jpg</code> to <code>.html</code>. When you open it in your browser, it will look almost the same, but you'll notice that your browser's background is now black, and the image has a weird green border around it, something it didn't have before. If you move your mouse over the image, you're going to find a mysterious text that leads to a strange website. I don't know who exactly created that webpage, but there's a ton of info on there.</p>

<p>Why whould somedy hide something inside an image?<br/>What are they hiding from us?<br/>What is "Niantic Project"?</p>
