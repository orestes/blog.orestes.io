<p>Now that <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2012" target="_blank">Fluent 2012</a> has come to an end, O'Reilly has posted all the videos from the conference in a YouTube playlist.
The whole playlist contains more than 50 videos, +5 hours of content. Not having been there is no longer an excuse to miss the talks!</p>
<p>Take your time and enjoy the great talks. This one by Brendan Eich was one of my favorites.</p>
