The <a href="https://www.nfcbootcamp.com/event-registration/?ee=22">NFC Bootcamp Barcelona 2012</a> was held as part of the <a href="http://www.smartcityexpo.com/" title=" Smart City Expo World Congress 2012" target="_blank"> Smart City Expo World Congress 2012</a> at the <a href="http://www.firabcn.es/en/venues_granvia" title="Fira Gran Via Convention Center" target="_blank">Fira Gran Via Convention Center</a> in Barcelona. We had some problems when trying to get our accreditations at the entrance but with a little help from the organisation we managed to finally get inside.

We met Robert P. Sabella from <a href="http://www.otatraining.com/" title="OTA Training" target="_blank">OTA Training</a> and we chatted for a bit while we waited for others to arrive. Rob started the day by introducing NFC and the work the <a href="http://www.nfcbootcamp.com/" title="NFC Bootcamp" target="_blank">NFC Bootcamp</a> has being doing for the past year.

Bastien Latge from <a href="http://www.insidesecure.com/" title="INSIDE Secure" target="_blank">INSIDE Secure</a> followed up with a more in depth talk about the key players in an NFC Ecosystem and underlined some of the most common problems and situations companies deploying NFC solutions encounter the most. He talked about the NFC parts, specially the Secure Element and the different implementations and security measures implemented in them. He also talked briefly about the hardware which provides NFC capabilities for mobile phones without built-in NFC tech.

Just before lunch, we met Stéphane Doutriaux from <a href="http://www.poken.com/" title="Poken" target="_blank">Poken</a>. He made a brief introduction about Poken with the following video.

Afterwards we all got our own pokens and did a little tour of the reception area and the schedule wall poster, touching the pokens along the way and getting comfortable with them.

After lunch, Gloria Lozano from <a href="http://ta.bcntouch.com/" title="BCN Touch" target="_blank">BCN Touch</a> gave her speech, focusing on use cases and their projects from the last past years. 

Then Stéphane came back to talk a bit more about the marketing and user experience side of NFC and how he thinks we should put the most of our efforts in providing some value rather than some technology, and use NFC as a means and not as a goal.

Overall, I think was a very nice intro to NFC and I'm looking forward for the "hands on" sessions tomorrow.
