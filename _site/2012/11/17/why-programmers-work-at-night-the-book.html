Programmer Swizec Teller and author of the (now) famous blog post <a href="Why programmers work at night" target="_blank">"Why programmers work at night"</a> has started a project on Leanpub to publish <a href="https://leanpub.com/nightowls/">a book about programmers</a>. 

Quoting from the author:
<blockquote>[...] In December 2011 I wrote down a bunch of assumptions about Why programmers work at night (link) in a blogpost. I wrote it because I got tired of being called a lazy slob for waking up at 11am every day.

After 4000 tweets, 10000 likes and many emails I didn't feel alone anymore.

The most surprising feedback were emails along the lines of "Oh man! I finally understand my husband, thanks so much for writing this!". And it is because of those that I have finally decided to write a short ebook.

In the book I'm going to:
<ul>
	<li>Show fellow night-time programmers (and others!) that they are not alone</li>
	<li>Give practical tips on living with your friendly neighborhood programmer</li>
	<li>Support my original hypotheses by interviewing cool programmers</li>
	<li>Explore the modern trend of super early wakeruppers who approach the night time from the other end</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you're a programmer that feels missunderstood on your late nights of happy coding, maybe this book will be an ideal gift for your roomies, girlfriend, boyfriend, parents or even for your boss.</p>
