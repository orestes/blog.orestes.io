I first learned about Petr Mitrichev the past year, when he won the 2011's Facebook Hacker Cup. He's a Google employee leading the current competitive programming challenges. He also keeps <a href="http://petr-mitrichev.blogspot.com">an interesting blog</a> where he talks about algorithms and sometimes challenges his readers with some problems.

MIT's Technology Review just published an introductory <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428610/in-the-olympics-of-algorithms-a-russian-keeps-winning-gold/">article </a>about him.
