<p>An excelent article by Swizec Teller about the reasons some programmers do their best work late at night.</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more with the author. The past year I stayed late at the office a lot of times doing a lot of good work (this year not so much because my girlfriend moved in with me :)) Also, when we were working on Aura, we would work until very late and wake up for lunch almost every day.</p>
