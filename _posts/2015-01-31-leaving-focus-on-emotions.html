<p>Not that long ago I wrote about the beginning of a new chapter. Well, that was a short chapter. In hindsight, I guess I was trying to motivate myself and push through the merger. In the end, I wasn't able to make it. I don't see myself in the new project and I decided to leave before taking on a vital project that's coming up next.</p>

<p>I'm writing this sitting at the cafe in the OVD Asturias airport. Javier Morales and I have been delegating our tasks to the Software Development team based of Gijón. We're closing up the Software Development Department in Barcelona, everything will be moved up here.</p>

<p>It's been a rough two weeks. We had an awful weather and we barely did anything besides coming and going from the hotel to the office. The other team is absorbing all the knowledge pretty well and we're confident they'll be able to maintain our software for however long the company decides to keep it running.</p>

<p>In my time at Focus On Emotions, my team grew an shrunk as the circumstances provided. Overall, I'm very satisfied with our work here and I'd like to take a moment thank everyone who has been part of the team.</p>

<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/virfaure">Virginie Faure</a></strong> worked with us at the very beginning of our product development. She wrote part of the core of our CMS and she moved in the blurry line that divides frontend and backend developers. She had a knack for interface and visual design and shaped the look and feel of our products.</p>

<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/spenya">Sergi Penya</a></strong> helped us quite a bit as a consultant. Most of our early interactivity projects where outsourced to him.</p>

<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/vgrdominik">Valentí Gmez</a></strong> wasn't even 20 years old when he joined Focus On Emotions. He took care of the CMS maintenance role and helped us tremendously when migrating our website to Twig.</p>

<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tekink_dr">Xavier Rubio</a></strong> helped us as an external consultant. He's truly one of the most fearless developers I know. Through the years, Xavi helped us on electronics, backend, fronted and a myriad of other aspects of our software.</p>

<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dimaslz">Dimas López</a></strong> came in to be the solid third dev on our team. We've been friends for many years but couldn't quite find the right opportunity to work together. In our time working together he absorbed all the knowledge like a sponge. It's been great seen him progress as fast and as far as he has now.</p>

<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elecash">Raúl Jienez</a></strong> consulted for us for almost two years. His work on our template engine made us one of the best solutions in the marked.</p>

<p>I'd like to give an special mention to <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/javi_moralesf">Javier Morales</a></strong>. He's been the most important part of the Software Development team for quite a while now. He's evolved into a serious Senior Developer, capable of chewing anything you throw at him. Without him, Focus On Emotions would've never been as successful as it got to be.</p>

<p>Thank you guys sharing your time with me. I'm really grateful I had your help through this years.</p>
