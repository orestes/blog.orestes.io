At the beginning of Day 2, we got a USB NFC reader and different cards with different NFC chips in them and Bastien finished his talk about the players in the NFC environment.

Then we met Fernando Cejas, a mobile developer based in Barcelona, working for <a href="http://flomio.com/">Flomio</a>. He's also de organiser of the Google Developers Group Barcelona. His talk was going to be more focused on de technical/developer side of NFC but due to the majority of the assistants being not technical, that part was skipped.

Before lunch, we went for a walk around the Smart City Expo and Fernando was captured by an evil robot.

After lunch, Fernando gave a more technical explanation of the NFC components, the different NDEF (<a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Understanding_NFC_Data_Exchange_Format_(NDEF)_messages">check out this great Nokia article about NDEF messages</a>) well known formats and the read/writing permissions. He also talked about the idea of  "cloud tags", flomio, the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flomio/flojack-nfc-for-ipad-and-iphone">FloJack</a> to provide NFC for iphone/ipad devices and other solution prototypes they had researched using other tech such as the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GuruPlug">GuruPlug</a>

Then Stéphane came back and we participated in a workshop with Poken and their partner tools. We created a campaing and linked a Poken Tag using the NFC Reader/Writer. We also learned a bit more about the technology used in Poken. It turns out, the Poken tags use the same technology as the regular Pokens. They are actually a Swatch licensed chip, with added NFC capabilities, a full USB stack and powered by a 9 volt battery that lasts about two years. Everything is encased in silicon so its fairly resistant, and of course, it's sticky. Poken Tags have to bee activated using an NFC writer and power themselves off when they are stacked or they detect too much inference to not drain the battery.

We all got an NFC Bootcamp completion certificate on behalf of OTA Training and the <a href="http://aenfc.com">AENFC</a> and we took some pictures.
It was a great experience and I'm sure both speakers and attendees will keep in touch with each other.
