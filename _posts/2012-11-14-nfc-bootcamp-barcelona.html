<p>The <a href="https://www.nfcbootcamp.com/event-registration/?ee=22">NFC Bootcamp Barcelona 2012</a> was held as
part of the <a href="http://www.smartcityexpo.com/" title=" Smart City Expo World Congress 2012" target="_blank">Smart
City Expo World Congress 2012</a> at the <a href="http://www.firabcn.es/en/venues_granvia" title="Fira Gran Via Convention Center" target="_blank">Fira
Gran Via Convention Center</a> in <strong>Barcelona</strong>.
We had some problems when trying to get our accreditations
at the entrance but with a little help from the organisation we managed to finally get inside.</p>

<p>We met <strong>Robert Sabella</strong> from
<a href="http://www.otatraining.com/" title="OTA Training" target="_blank">OTA Training</a> and we chatted for a bit
while we waited for others to arrive. Rob started the day by introducing NFC and the
work the <a href="http://www.nfcbootcamp.com/" title="NFC Bootcamp" target="_blank">NFC Bootcamp</a> has being doing
for the past year.</p>

<p>Bastien Latge from <a href="http://www.insidesecure.com/" title="INSIDE Secure" target="_blank">INSIDE Secure</a>
followed up with a more in depth talk about the key players in an NFC Ecosystem and underlined some of the most
common problems and situations companies deploying NFC solutions encounter the most. He talked about the NFC parts,
specially the <strong>Secure Element</strong> and the different implementations and security measures implemented in
them. He also talked briefly about the hardware which provides NFC capabilities for mobile phones without
built-in NFC tech.</p>

Just before lunch, we met Stéphane Doutriaux from
<a href="http://www.poken.com/" title="Poken" target="_blank">Poken</a>. He made a brief introduction about
<strong>Poken</strong> with a video. Afterwards we all got our own pokens and did a little tour of the reception
area and the schedule wall poster, poking along the way and getting comfortable with the devices.</p>

<p>After lunch, <strong>Gloria Lozano </strong> from <a href="http://ta.bcntouch.com/" title="BCN Touch" target="_blank">BCN Touch</a>
gave her talk, focusing on use cases and their projects from the last past years.</p>

<p>Then Stéphane came back to talk a bit more about the marketing and user experience side of NFC and how he thinks
we should put the most of our efforts in providing some value rather than some technology, and use NFC as a means
and not as a goal.</p>

<p>At the beginning of day 2, we got a USB NFC reader and different cards with different NFC chips in them and Bastien
finished his talk about the players in the NFC environment.

<p>Then we met <strong>Fernando Cejas</strong>, a mobile developer based in Barcelona, working for
<a href="http://flomio.com/">Flomio</a>. He's also de organiser of the <strong>Google Developers Group Barcelona</strong>.
His talk was going to be more focused on de technical/developer side of NFC but due to the majority of the assistants
being not so technical that part was skipped. Bummer.</p>

<p>

    Before lunch, we went for a walk around the Smart City Expo and Fernando was captured by an evil robot.
    After we rescued him, Fernando gave a more technical explanation of the NFC components, the different NDEF
    well known formats and the read/writing permissions.
    He also talked about the idea of "cloud tags", <strong>flomio</strong>, the
    <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flomio/flojack-nfc-for-ipad-and-iphone">FloJack</a> to provide NFC for
    iphone/ipad devices and other solution prototypes they had researched using other tech such as the
    <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GuruPlug">GuruPlug</a>
</p>

<p>
    Then Stéphane came back and we participated in a workshop with Poken and their partner tools. We created a campaign
    and linked a Poken Tag using the NFC Reader/Writer. We also learned a bit more about the technology used in Poken.
    The Poken tags use the same technology as the regular Pokens.
    <img src="{{ media_url }}/poken-tag.jpg" alt="Poken Tag" title="Poken Tag" class="img-polaroid use-right"/>
    They use a <strong>Swatch</strong> licensed
    chip with added NFC capabilities and a full USB stack,powered by a 9 volt battery that lasts about two years.
    Everything is encased in silicon so its fairly resistant, and of course, it's sticky. Poken Tags have to be
    activated using an NFC writer and power themselves off when they are stacked or they detect too much inference
    to not drain the battery.
</p>

<p>
    We all got an NFC Bootcamp completion certificate on behalf of OTA Training and the
    <a href="http://aenfc.com">AENFC</a> and we took some pictures. It was a great experience and I'm sure both
    speakers and attendees will keep in touch with each other.
