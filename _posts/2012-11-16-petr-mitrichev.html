<p>I first learned about <strong>Petr Mitrichev</strong> the past year when he won 2011's Facebook Hacker Cup. He's a Google developer
leading the current competitive programming challenges. He also keeps an interesting blog at
<a  target="_blank" href="http://petr-mitrichev.blogspot.com">petr-mitrichev.blogspot.com</a> where he talks
about algorithms and sometimes challenges his readers with some problems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com" target="_blank">MIT's Technology Review</a> has a nice introductory
<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428610/in-the-olympics-of-algorithms-a-russian-keeps-winning-gold/">article</a>
about him.</p>

<p>I also found some interesting reading material if you're into competitive programming.
<a href="http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/70">Codeforces</a> has a great post about Sao Paulo Training Camp 2010
containing his solutions to problems and some video explanations.

<p class="update"><strong>Update March 2013</strong>: He came up on top at 2013's Facebook Hacker Cup as well. This is guy is amazing :)</p>
