<p>Recently we got a couple of projects at <strong><a href="http://focusonemotions.com" target="_blank">Focus On
Emotions</a></strong>, from a company that has a loyalty program card. Among the challenging stuff we did for them
there was a project for automating the process of the users registering and getting this cards, making it easier and
more convenient. The final product was a user kiosk with an interactive touch screen a physical keyboard and mouse.
This project needed a couple of tricky features: <strong>ID verification</strong> and <strong>bank credit
authorization</strong>. We have two other public kiosk projects for Ajuntament de Barcelona (the city hall)
which allows citizens to do paperwork, but none of them used any banking data.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks after the project's launch we had gotten many reports of users being disoriented when following
the process. One of the steps required the users to physically place their ID form on a small flatbed scanner
for validation. Even though the physical space was an obvious empty box the users didn't realise that was where
they were supposed to place their ID.</p>

<p>The client asked us to modify the kiosk structure, add a LED stripe around the empty box and have it blink when the
users got to the ID validation step. We had to give it a little thought before coming up with a solution because we
had a tricky problem: <strong>hardware access was impossible</strong>. The whole application was written
in Java, HTML and JavaScript,and it ran as a served web app inside a secured environment using SiteKiosk. This was
great for pushing software changes to the multiple kiosks installed for the project as well as for interacting with
the bank's backoffice services in a secured environment (server-side). The manufacturer for the ID scanner had
provided the dev team with an API that used ActiveX and JavaScript to control their hardware, so we followed that
idea: we had to develop our own ActiveX control to activate the LED stripe whenever we needed to.</p>

<p>We bought a simple relay board with an USB interface and started working on it. This relay board was great
because it had two different relays that you could control independently. Each relay had a tiny onboard LED indicating
its state. You can find it on PCRobot <a href="">here</a>. I got a hold of the specification and wrote a simple
program to control it over USB by sending the byte-encoded messages for each action (open/close relay 1/2). Once I
had the small PoC, I converted it to a library and compiled it as an ActiveX. I did this from Windows using the CSC
tool provided by the .NET framework.<br/>
<code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc.exe /t:library USBLEDControllerLib.cs</code></br>
This DLL must be registered using <code>regasm</code> to make it available for Internet Explorer<br/>
<code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\regasm.exe /tlb /codebase USBLEDControllerLib.dll</code>
</p>

<p>To invoke the ActiveX control we use the full classname, including namespace.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var controller = new ActiveXObject("FOE.USBLEDControllerLib");
var version = controller.getFirmwareVersion();
console.log('Running FOE USB LED Controller version ' + version);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>A simple ActiveX control will trigger a security warning on IE. We suppressed this warning by implementing
a few visible COM methods flagged as <code>[Serializable, ComVisible(true)]</code> which come from the
<code><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751977(v=vs.85).aspx">IObjectSafety</a></code>
interface. This told IE it could trust our library.</p>

<p>The controller for the board had a limited set of functions so we had to extend them for our project. I added
a couple of threaded functions to start/stop blinking the LEDs synchronously, stopping/starting only one of them
and have the other synchronize on start, etc... Even though we had very little time and a lot of pressure I think
it was a fun project.</p>
