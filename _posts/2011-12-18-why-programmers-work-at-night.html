<p>I just An excelent article by <a target="_blank" href="http://swizec.com/"><strong>Swizec Teller</strong></a> about
the reasons <a target="_blank" href="http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198">some programmers
do their best work late at night</a>.</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more with the author. The past year I stayed late at the office a lot of times doing a lot of good
work. This year not so much because my girlfriend moved in with me, so I've gotten some rest from that but I kind of
miss it too. When we were working on <a href="{{ site.url }}/tag/aura">Aura</a>, we would work until very late and wake
up for lunch almost every day.</p>
