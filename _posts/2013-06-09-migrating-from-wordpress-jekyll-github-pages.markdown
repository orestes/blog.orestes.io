My blogging has been irregular, erratic and inconsistent since I started in 2011, and I'm trying to improve. I read a lot of interesting blogs and I follow a lot interesting developers, so I'm constantly thinking about all this new ideas and discussions, and they really make an impact on me. This results in a lot of experiments that I've been collecting on my lab, which I'm also organising and trying to order.

Besides my writting skills, my problem was my blogging software, Wordpress. I think it's just too much for what I want.
I don't need something dynamic, slow (even if I use caching systems), heavy and potentially insecure. I don't want my vm exploding whenever I get a traffic spike,
I don't want to be patching and upgrading my WP modules and being worried about security issues. I want a static blog website, and the awesome [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for the comments.

So I started researching about scaffolding tools and generators for static websites and I found about GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
I had read about them in the past but never really tried them, and I must say they're a perfect fit.
I can use any domain I own, I can share the source code for my blog, I can version my posts and contents and I don't have to worry
about security updates or server resources.

I've been getting busy with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) for the past week and I must say I love it.
