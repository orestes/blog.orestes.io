title: Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll on GitHub Pages
---
Besides my writting skills, my problem with blogging was the software I was using, Wordpress. Although I made use of
lots of the features something just never seemed right. I found it slow heavy and
often insecure. I didn't want my vm exploding whenever I got a traffic spike, I didn't want to be patching and upgrading
my WP modules and being worried about security issues. It was kind of hard to get it to look the way I wanted it. I
wrote a custom theme but I wasn't really satisfied with it, so I bought a one which looked cool, but I still wasn't
happy with my blog because it wasn't "mine".

I wanted a static blog website that I could code and style however I wanted. So I started researching about scaffolding
tools and generators for static websites and I found about GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I had read about them in the past
but never really tried. When I got to it I knew I had found the solution for me.

The pros of switching from WP on my hosting to Jekyll on gh-pages

 * I don't have to worry about security issues since everything is static
 * I can version my posts and contents using a CVS I love (git)
 * I can _easily_ share the source code for my blog
 * I don't have to worry about hosting
 * I can use any domain I own
 * It provides higher geek factor than having a WP blog

The cons

 * GitHub crashes every once in a while and maybe GH Pages come down with it

In the next few days I'll try to add the old posts and extend them a bit. I also have a bunch of drafts that I never got
 around to publish so I'll try to finish them too.
