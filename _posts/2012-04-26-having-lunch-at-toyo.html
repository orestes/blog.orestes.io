I really love <a href="http://www.restaurantetoyo.com/" target="_blank">Toyo</a>. It has a classic sushi conveyor belt
and is just one block away from the office. The owners are actually chinese but their food is amazing! They're so nice and they've even learned our preferences so
whenever I sit down I get the first Teriyaki Chicken that comes out of the kitchen. We have lunch here almost every week
and they make us feel really welcomed. If you're ever in Barcelona, check out, you'll love it!</p>
