<p>I really love this restaurant. It has a classic sushi conveyor belt and is just one block away from the office.
The owners are actually chinese but their food is amazing! They're so nice and they've even learned our preferences so
whenever I sit down I get the first Teriyaki Chicken that comes out of the kitchen. We have lunch here almost every week
and they make us feel really welcomed. I'm going to miss this place when we move to the new office, wherever that may be...</p>
