I love shortcuts. Specifically, keyboard shortcuts. Quick keystrokes that invoke
 commands and menu options. I couldn't live without them. But that's me. It seems
 normal that  people don't use them at all save for <code>CTRL+C</code> and 
<code>CTRL+V</code>.

One of the main goals as developers is automating repetitive and error-prone 
tasks. There's very few things that can get as repetitive as clicking OK 
or Cancel on dialogs, checking boxes or navigating between form fields. And yet,
 very few people use <code>Tab</code> or <code>Shift+Tab</code> to navigate 
between form fields, <code>Space</code> to check checkboxes and 
<code>Enter</code> or <code>Escape</code> to accept o dismiss dialogs. I can 
totally understand that the average computer user won't get used to this, but 
I can't respect a developer that doesn't know his tools. And that doesn't mean
 you have to be an Emacs guru, but regardless of your tool of choice, you 
better show me your skills when I'm interviewing you.
</p>

<p>That's what 
this is all about; mastering your tools. I don't care that much about the particular
tool as long as you prove that you know it inside out. I'm not the only one who thinks on 
this vein. I recently read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nicolasbize.com/blog/the-best-ide-in-the-world/">the best IDE in the world</a> by Nichas Bize and I found myself bobbing my head in agreement all along.
