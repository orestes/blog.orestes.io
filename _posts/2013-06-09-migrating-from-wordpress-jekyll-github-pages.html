title: Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll on GitHub Pages
---
<p>Besides my writing skills, my problem with blogging was the software I was using, <strong>Wordpress</strong>. I found it slow, heavy and often insecure. I didn’t want my server exploding whenever I got a traffic spike, I didn’t want upgrading my WP modules and being worried about security issues. It was kind of hard to get it to look the way I wanted it. I wrote a custom theme but I wasn’t really satisfied with it, so I bought a one which looked cool, but I still wasn’t happy with my blog because it wasn’t “mine”.</p>

<p>I wanted a static blog website that I could code and style the way I wanted, without restrictions. I wouldn’t have to worry about security since it would be static and would have no user input, search or comment features. I didn’t want to give up comments so I checked <strong>Disqus</strong>, whichs a really good commenting platform that you can embed anywhere without having to worry about security or performance issues. Disqus is a seamless iframe whith a lot of clever programming inside. <strong>Ben Vinegar</strong>, gave a great talk about it in 2012: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQCm8VYn93Y">Seamless iframes: The future, today!</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding the traffic spikes and server resources, I decided I’d move the blog out of my lab hosting (which is a tiny virtual machine) into somewhere that could serve static sites and I only had to worry about bandwith costs,</p>

<p>I started researching about scaffolding tools and generators for static websites. I had used stuff like <strong>yeoman</strong> that worked reat for getting something started quickly, but it was more aimed at apps than static websites and I’d still have to do a lot of the work.</p>

<p>Then I found about <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> and <strong>Jekyll</strong>, and they turned out to be the perfect solution for me. <strong>Jekyll</strong> is a blog-aware static website generator written in Ruby by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/"><strong>Tom Preston-Werner</strong></a>. It’s easy to get started with and powerful enough to let you add your own plugins and teach it new tricks. <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> allows you to serve static content from your GitHub repositories without any setup</p>

<p><strong>The pros Jekyll on GitHub Pages</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It’s already blog-aware, so it has a notion of posts, categories, tags and a timeline.</li>

<li>I can version my posts and contents using a CVS I love (git)</li>

<li>I can <em>easily</em> share the source code for my blog</li>

<li>I don’t have to worry about hosting</li>

<li>I can still use any domain name I own</li>

<li>It provides higher geek factor than having a WP blog</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>GitHub crashes every once in a while and maybe GH Pages comes down with it</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="working_with_github_pages">Working with GitHub Pages</h5>

<p>GitHub Pages are divided into user pages and project pages. The only thing you have to do is create a <code>gh-pages</code> branch on your repository. Whatever you push to the branch will be served on your project page at <code>http://username.github.com/repository-name</code>. If you push a Jekyll site, GitHub Pages will actually build the site for you and serve that instead of the Jekyll source.</p>

<h5 id="working_with_jekyll">Working with Jekyll</h5>

<p>You create a new site running <code>jekyll new PATH</code> which creates a bare minimum site config and layouts.</p>

<p>To create the extra tag and category index, as well as the archived month pages, I had to extend the same classes: <code>Jekyll::Page</code> and <code>Jekyll:Generator</code>. The method is pretty straightforward:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a class that inherits from <code>Jekyll:Page</code></li>

<li>In the page class, implement the <code>initialise</code> method</li>

<li>In the <code>initialise</code> method, call <code>self.process(@name)</code> and <code>self.read_yaml</code> to get the contents of the layout</li>

<li>Add to the <code>site.data</code> Hash any data you want to expose to the page</li>

<li>Create a class that inherits from <code>Jekyll:Generator</code></li>

<li>Implement the <code>generate(site)</code> method which adds instances of the custom page to the <code>site.pages</code> Array</li>
</ol>

<p>I generated the monthly archive by iterating over the <code>site.posts</code> Array and analysing the dates. To generate the sidebar menu that displays the year/month list I needed to have an index to iterate over, so I coded my plugin <code>archive_helper</code>. What I did was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inherit from <code>Jekyll::Site</code>,</li>

<li>Made an alias of the original <code>site_payload</code></li>

<li>In my <code>site_payload</code> method, called the original <code>site_payload</code> and get the returned data.</li>

<li>Added to <code>site.data</code> Hash the indexes created from the posts’ dates.</li>
</ol>

<p>The plugins to generate the tag and a category pages were already provided in the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">Jekyll plugin docs</a> so I didn’t need to do any extra work.</p>

<p>You can get the source code for my plugins and all of this blog <a href="https://github.com/orestes/blog.orestes.io">here</a></p>

<h5 id="deploying_the_site">Deploying the site</h5>

<p>The problem I had with my plugins is that GitHub pages builds the Jekyll sites using the <code>--safe</code> switch, which disables them. The alternative is to push your source code to the <code>master</code> branch and your generated site files to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. I didn’t want to do it manually every time I updated the source, so I wrote a little <code>post-commit</code> hook that generates the site, wipes the <code>gh-pages</code> branch and pushes the freshly generated site to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<h5 id="using_a_custom_domain_name">Using a custom domain name</h5>

<p>Everything gets served from <code>http://username.github.com/repository-name</code>. Having a good grasp of the HTTP
protocol is crucial for a web developer, and I think we should also know at least a little about the DNS protocol. I
wanted to host my blog under <code>blog.orestes.io</code>, so I got to my DNS panel on my domain registrar and added
a new <code>CNAME</code> DNS entry for <code>orestes.io</code> with the name was <code>blog</code> and the value
<code>orestes.github.com</code>. A <strong>CNAME</strong> is a <strong>Canonical Name</strong> entry, which tells
DNS clients asking where <code>blog.orestes.io</code> is, to ask instead for <code>orestes.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s check what’s going on with my domain name using nslookup.</p>

<pre><code>$ nslookup blog.orestes.io
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
blog.orestes.io	canonical name = orestes.github.io.
orestes.github.io	canonical name = github.map.fastly.net.
Name:	github.map.fastly.net
Address: 103.245.223.196</code></pre>

<p>On the output above you can see how everything is being redirected to github.map.fastly.net</p>

<p>When you finally get to the HTTP server behind <code>github.map.fastly.net</code>, it checks the HTTP 1.1 “Host” header, which is sent by the browser and will contain the value <code>blog.orestes.io</code>. Then the GH Pages takes a look under the user’s projects and their /CNAME files to check if any of this projects is assigned to this domain. If there is, you get the static site, if there isn’t, a 404 error.</p>
