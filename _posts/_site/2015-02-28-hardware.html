<p>Being a software developer is nice. Learning something new usually means downloading some SDK, running some new software or writting a different software. But still, the vast majority of written software runs on the same kinds of machines; screens. More often than not, you get to run your software on fancy touchscreens, interact with a mouse and keyboard. I like to break those boundaries and play with stuff that doesn't need a user to fullfill a purpose.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I bough an Arduino starter kit, and embarked on an the awesome journey to the Internet Of Things</p>

<<p>This simple experiment doesn't look like much, but to me, it felt incredibly liberating. From then on, sensors, servos and DC motors have made learning really fun.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a fun hobby that involves programming, I cannot recommend this enough. I recently got a <a href="http://fritzing.org/shop/starter-kit/" target="_bnlank">Fritzing Starter Kit</a> and I coultn't be happier!</p>
