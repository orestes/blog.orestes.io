<p>The playlist rom the recent GOTO Aarhus 2012 has been published on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">Jez Humble</a></strong>'s "Implementing Continuous Delivery" where he talks about the organisational problems, mistakes
and misconceptions that come up when trying to implement <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> has been one of my favourites.</p>
